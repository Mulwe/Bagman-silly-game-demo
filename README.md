# Bagman (Demo)

**Bagman** is a 2D top-down demo game where the player collects carts and delivers them to the spawn point.  
This is an early-stage prototype â€” many features are still under development.

## ðŸŽ® Gameplay

You control a character who can attach up to 3 carts using chain-like physics connections.  
Each cart affects your stamina and fatigue depending on its weight and the ambient temperature.  
The main objective is to collect all the carts and bring them back to the central spawn area.

## âœ… Implemented Features

- Main menu with basic navigation
- Randomized object spawning in a defined area **without overlaps**
- Attaching carts to the player using physics joints
- Scene loading system with a simple **Loading** placeholder
- Pause menu
- Black square in the center of the screen as a placeholder for **control hints**

## ðŸš§ In Progress / Not Implemented

- Stamina and fatigue mechanics
- Temperature-based effects
- Victory/defeat conditions
- UI hints and feedback system
- Final visuals and animations
- Game progression and scoring

## ðŸ•¹ Controls

- `WASD` â€” Move
- `E` â€” Attach a nearby cart
- `Q` â€” Detach all connected carts
- `ESC` â€” Pause / Menu

## ðŸ›  How to Run

> Built with **Unity**

1. Open the project in Unity (recommended version: 2022.x or later)
2. Open and run the `MainScene`
3. Or build the project for your target platform (e.g. Windows, WebGL)

## ðŸ“Œ Planned Features

- Stamina and fatigue system
- Environmental temperature interaction
- Weight-based drag and stamina cost
- Proper win/loss conditions
- UI/UX polish including dynamic control hints
